				Officials and experts are divided in their opinions on the advisability of requiring social distancing and health declarations with some in favor and others against.
				<br>
				At a Ho Chi Minh City's meeting Wednesday, Nguyen Van Nen, secretary of the city's Party Committee, said it was no longer necessary to request social distancing and avoidance of mass gatherings.
				<br>
				"Given the current situation, wearing a mask and disinfecting hands are the only feasible options," he said.
				<br>
				In August 2020, the Ministry of Health issued a protocol in order to contain the spread of Covid, warning people to wear masks, disinfect their hands frequently, keep a safe distance from each other, avoid crowds and complete health declarations.
				<br>
				Since then, given the "complicated" developments of the pandemic, the protocol has become a mandate and those who fail to follow it are seen as law breakers to be dealt with accordingly.
				<br>
				But, said Nen: "The situation has changed and if we keep applying the same protocol without making any adjustments, it would create obstacles for people."
				<br>
				Truong Huu Khanh, an epidemiologist and a member of the National Board for Vaccine Evaluation, also said the ministryâ€™s protocol should now be changed because the city has already reopened and almost all activities have resumed.
				<br>
				Wearing masks and disinfecting hands are still significant but the rules on keeping distance and avoiding gatherings should be reconsidered, he said.
				<br>
				"It is now almost impossible for companies to ask its employees to keep a distance of two meters from each other.
				<br>
				"The health declaration is also no longer necessary because tracking related cases is no longer important, given that the number of infections in the community is very large and most people have been vaccinated," he added.
				<br>
				Tran Van Ngoc, President of the HCMC Respiratory Association, shared the same view, saying the requirement for health declaration was no longer relevant and should be abolished.
